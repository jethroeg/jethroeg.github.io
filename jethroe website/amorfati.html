            <h2>Amor Fati: Love of one's fate</h2>
            <p class="quote">
              My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to 
              be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is 
              necessary, still less conceal it… but love it. 
            </p>

              We torture ourselves. Yes, we are always thinking about the things that we cannot take back. 
              We are blaming ourselves for not being the person that we want to be. It is part of human 
              nature to care about what other people think and that puts a burden to how we live our lives. 
              In a life that is dedicated to the pursuit of excellence, we tend to regret our school grades, not 
              getting that promotion, not getting accepted to our dream college, or being left out in terms 
              of career. For me, that is one of the core human struggles — caring too much about what other 
              people think and blaming ourselves for the things we cannot change. Like, why even care? 
              We are encompassed by regret that we even feel frustrated for little things 
              (yes, I am pertaining to that embarrassing thing you did years ago that will pop up to your 
              mind at 12 midnight that no one even remembers). 
            </p>

              For the famous German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the key to human greatness is 
              Amor Fati, a Latin phrase which translates as 'a love of one's fate'. This is the total 
              acceptance of everything that happened and will happen in our lives. Total acceptance of how 
              things went and how it will go. A feeling where you surrender yourself to your own fate with 
              full acceptance that if you were to relive your life, you wouldn't want to change anything. 
              This is what's missing in most of our lives. We are existing but not truly living. We forget 
              about the simple things in life that we should be thankful for and we live in constant 
              restlessness. Life should be a beautiful adventure. We forgot to enjoy the simple indulgence 
              of life and let fate work on its own.
